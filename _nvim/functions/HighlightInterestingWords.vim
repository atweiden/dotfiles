" Highlight Word {{{
"
" This mini-plugin provides a few mappings for highlighting words temporarily.
"
" Sometimes you're looking at a hairy piece of code and would like a certain
" word or two to stand out temporarily. You can search for it, but that only
" gives you one color of highlighting. Now you can use <leader>N where N is
" a number from 1-6 to highlight the current word in a specific color.

function! HiInterestingWord(n) " {{{
" Save our location.
    normal! mz

" Yank the current word into the z register.
    normal! "zyiw

" Calculate an arbitrary match ID. Hopefully nothing else is using it.
    let mid = 86750 + a:n

" Clear existing matches, but don't worry if they don't exist.
    silent! call matchdelete(mid)

" Construct a literal pattern that has to match at boundaries.
    let pat = '\V\<' . escape(@z, '\') . '\>'

" Actually match the words.
    call matchadd("InterestingWord" . a:n, pat, 1, mid)

" Move back to our original location.
    normal! `z
endfunction " }}}
